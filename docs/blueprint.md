# **App Name**: Tabula Rasa

## Core Features:

- Blank Canvas: Displays a blank page.
- Content Reset: Option to clear all existing content to return to the blank state.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Subtle off-white (#FAF9F6) for a sense of cleanliness and emptiness.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0) to provide minimal contrast.
- Accent color: Light, muted blue (#D3E0EA) for any interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for any minimal UI text (e.g., help text) to provide a clean, modern feel.
- Simple, outlined icons will be used sparingly to maintain the focus on the blank space.
- The page will be a full-screen layout with minimal margins to maximize the blank space.
- Subtle fade-in animation upon loading to gently introduce the blank canvas.
